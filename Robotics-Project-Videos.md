# Robotics Project Course Submission
In addition to Perception, the mobile robot also had the following pipelines:
- Localization and mapping using particle filter.
- Path planning and control using A star to traverse from point A to B.
- System Integration using a state machine (smach package in ROS)
If you're interested to know more on how these pipelines are integrated in ROS, check out our [Project page](https://github.com/RAS-2018-grp-4).
